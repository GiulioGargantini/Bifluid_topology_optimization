# Bifluid_topology_optimization

This repository gathers the Python code in support of the MSc thesis *Design of bi-fluid heat exchangers using topology optimization*, defended at Politecnico di Milano on the 24 July 2020, developed by Giulio Gargantini under the supervision of prof. Nicola Parolini and prof. Marco Verani.

The three folders of this repository contain each the Python code of one chapter of the thesis:
- **CH3\_Topology\_Optimization** contains the code developed for the project *Solution of optimal control problems using a finite element discrete adjoint formulation* and adapted for Ch. 3 of the thesis, and concerns the topology optimization of a 2D domain with respect to a multi-objective cost functional [1], [2];
- **CH4\_Dimensional\_Reduction\_of\_a\_Heatsink** gathers the code to simulate and optimize a 2D reduced model of a tridimensional heatsink, as presented in [3] and in Ch. 4 of the thesis;
- **CH5\_Bifluid\_Optimization** contains two simulation of bi-fluid scenarios, as discussed in Ch. 5 of the thesis and in [4].

The text of the thesis can be found at the web page: https://www.politesi.polimi.it .
